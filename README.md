## 📝 Development Blog
### Week 1: Project Initiation
We formed Group 5 (Hannah Sanders, Jeremiah Whitehurst, Saniyah Bullock, and Javon Edmunds) in our Intro to Web Development class to create a web application addressing student collaboration challenges. After brainstorming ideas like a news tracker and homeless shelter locator, we settled on a study buddy application to help Delaware State University students connect randomly to enhance their education.

### Week 2: Planning & Ideation
Using Let Us Meet for scheduling, we refined our concept with:

- Finalized problem statement: "Delaware State University students need a web application that allows them to coordinate with like-minded students"
- Added features like a leaderboard (Saniyah's idea) and "close friend" access control (Javon's suggestion)

### Week 3: Role Assignment & Initial Development
Roles established:
- Jeremiah Whitehurst: Project Manager
- Hannah Sanders: Designer
- Javon Edmunds: Blogger
- Saniyah Bullock: Contributing Member

We created an ideation board with 15-20 potential features while beginning work on sign-in pages, database design, and blog documentation.

### Week 4: Development Progress
Team established regular meetings with focused work:
- Hannah: User authentication
- Saniyah: Navigation bar
- Jeremiah: Database modeling
- Javon: Study resources section

### Week 5: Technology Shift
- Completed sprint backlog and made major decision to:
- Migrate from JavaScript to React
- Restructure entire codebase for better presentation
- Conducted multiple meetings to coordinate the transition

### Week 6: React Challenges
Faced difficulties in code migration due to React's differences from our original JavaScript implementation. Professor provided additional React instruction to help us overcome these challenges.

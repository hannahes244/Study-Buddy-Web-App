When evaluating this task, our first step was to develop our problem statement. During this process, numerous ideas were brought up for our project, such as a study buddy application, a news tracker application, a group scheduling application, and a homeless shelter locator, among others. These discussions ultimately led us to our final decision: a study buddy web application designed to help Delaware State University students connect to enhance their education and studying skills. Overall, this week served as a great introduction, allowing us to break the ice between members and get to know our project scope.\", \"This week, our project manager, Jeremiah, helped manage our meetings using LettuceMeet, a scheduling tool. We could all share our schedules and find a comfortable and available meeting time for each member. With the ability to schedule group meetings, we were able to come together and brainstorm additional ideas to refine our future presentation. We further developed our Study Buddy Website by creating initial user stories as a group while Hannah finalized our official problem statement: Delaware State University students need a web application that allows them to coordinate with like-minded students to form study groups because they need an easier and more effective method of connecting with each other. Javon and Saniyah also contributed valuable ideas to enhance our overall project presentation and align it with the rubric given to Group 5. Saniyah proposed the idea of incorporating a leaderboard with challenges and quests to encourage engagement, while Javon suggested implementing restricted access based on a “close friend” feature that would allow users to control their connections within the application. Week 2 provided our group with a significant boost in morale and a clearer understanding of our professor’s expectations for the project.\", \"In the third week, we came together to finalize our tasks for the upcoming week. We also redefined our roles: Jeremiah as our Product/Backlog Manager and Hannah, Saniyah, and Javon as Front-End Developers. Moving forward as a group, we created our initial ideation board and generated at least 15 to 20 ideas that we wanted to implement into our overall Study Buddy presentation. As Hannah continued working on the sign-in and profile creation, Jeremiah began developing the initial database for our project, while Javon started working on our group blog presentation. Meanwhile, Saniyah focused on expanding our ideation board.\", \"In Week Four, we got into our rhythm, assigning a set group meeting time, which would be primarily 4:15 Mondays and Wednesdays. Our sprint this week included, Hannah starting the user authentication (sign-up/sign-in), Saniyah starting the navigation bar, Jeremiah developing the database, and Javon creating the study resources page. Overall, this week was very productive, with the group meeting twice and overall having consistent communication throughout Discord and in-person. We established group roles and displayed positive progress toward the final project.\", \"In Week Five, we completed our sprint backlog, where all of our tasks as a group are managed. With this, we were able to move forward to other tasks, such as Hannah transitioning our code from HTML/CSS to React.js, which would give our overall presentation a smoother look. The group then decided to merge everything into React.js. The group took this week to discuss ideas and transfer our JavaScript and HTML codes to the React.js format. The group had a very productive week, with us meeting twice and having a lot of communication in Discord.\", \"In Week Six, we struggled with being able to transfer all of our code to React.js due to its differences from JavaScript. With this, we researched and obtained knowledge from Intro to Web Development, which helped us develop a React.js app and properly structure our web application. This week wasn’t as productive due to the struggle with transferring the code, but overall, we still met up twice as planned and had conversations about the project to make sure our final presentation would be up to par.\", \"While still in the process of translating everything to React.js, we focused on our tasks. Jeremiah kept working on the backend to make sure everything would run smoothly during integration. As a team, we met up twice to go over future ideas and improvements, and we made sure to stay in sync about our strengths and challenges. After making some solid progress, we reassigned tasks: Saniyah started working on the dashboard and homepage, Hannah focused on the sign-up/sign-in features, and Jeremiah continued building out the database for both the front-end and back-end.
